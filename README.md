# README
#### for bubble dynamics with multiscale residual neural networks

## script_DTP.py
Calls the algorithms listed above in the following order:
#### D
Data is generated by calling gen_data.py
#### T 
Trains ResNets by calling train_models.py
#### P 
Plots results and errors for each ResNet by calling plot_models.py

## gen_data.py

Numerically solves system of ODEs defined by the Rayleigh-Plesset equation using SciPy's **solve_ivp**(method='LSODA').

**T = n * dt** is the total time of the solution

**dt** = smallest time step

**n** = maximum number of time steps

Many solutions are created for a range of random initial conditions. 

This data is saved as a tensor for training and validating various ResNets.

Parameters are adjusted in file *parameters.yml* (see below)

##train_models.py
Trains ResNets with an adjustable architecture. Each ResNet is a time-stepper trained at different step-sizes.

Parameters are adjusted in file *parameters.yml* (see below)

## plot_models.py

Visualizes predictions made by individual time-steppers (ResNets).

Determines which "combination" of time-steppers (ResNets) produces the best mean-squared-error (MSE) by removing smallest time-steppers first.

Visualizes MSE of individual time-steppers and multi-scale time-steppers, the ensemble of ResNets.

Visualizes predictions made by multi-scale time-steppers, the ensemble of ResNets.

Final plot color codes the 3 largest time-steppers for predictions made by multi-scale ResNets.

## parameters.yml 

Adjust parameters for generating data and training your ResNets (time-steppers).  

Read by algorithm as a Python dictionary. 

### (1) Parameters for both data and training time-steppers (ResNets)

**system** = 'RP' stands for Rayleigh-Plesset and is used in file names saved by python scripts
